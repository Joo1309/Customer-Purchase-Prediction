# Customer Purchase Prediction

This project builds a classification model to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on demographic and behavioral data.

---

## 📌 Objective
To develop a machine learning pipeline that:
- Loads and preprocesses customer data
- Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Trains multiple classification models
- Evaluates performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix
- Selects the best-performing model

---

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset includes features such as:
- Age
- Gender
- Annual Income
- Spending Score
- Previous Purchase Behavior
- Engagement Metrics

Target variable: **Purchase (Yes/No)**

---

## 🛠 Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Understanding**  
   Load dataset, inspect shape, columns, and target variable.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, scale numerical features, and split into train/test sets.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Distribution plots  
   - Correlation heatmaps  
   - Customer behavior insights  

4. **Model Building**  
   Implement and compare:
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Decision Tree  
   - Random Forest  
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   Compare models using:
   - Accuracy  
   - Precision  
   - Recall  
   - F1-Score  
   - Confusion Matrix

## 📈 Deliverables
- Clean and documented Jupyter Notebook (`project.ipynb`)
- Visualizations from EDA and evaluation
- Model comparison summary
- Insights on customer purchase behavior
